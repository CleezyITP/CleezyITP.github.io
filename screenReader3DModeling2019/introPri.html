<h1>Intro to 3D Printing</h1>
<h2>Additive Manufacturing</h2>
<ul>
<li>3D printing is an additive manufacturing process that creates 3d objects </li>
<li>In really general terms, the process begins by creating designs from 3 Dimensions or parameters. Then these digital models are sliced into many 2 dimensional cross-sections that are then printed one on top of the other.</li>
<li>This slicing and rebuilding of shapes is referred to as additive manufacturing</li>
<li>As a technique, additive manufacturing has existed for centuries</li>
<li>For example, ancient Greeks built large columns by assembling smaller layers</li>
</ul>

   <h2 name="Types of 3D Printing" id="Types of 3D Printing">Types of 3D Printing</h2>
      <ul>   
        <li>FDM fused deposition modeling: material is heated into a softened state and extruded from a nozzle – the bed is lowered as the object assembles</li>
        <li>SLA/DLP machine Stereolithography/Digital Light Processing: a bed is lowered into a volume of liquid polymer, and a laser or focused light cures the material to a hardened state in layers as the bed moves away from the liquid.</li>
        <li>SLS Selective Laser Sintering: a powder is used in place of a liquid or a solid polymer, and a laser “sinters” or cures the powder in layers which are added by a sweeper.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2 name="Process" id="Process">Process</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Modelling with software or scanning/photogrammetry techniques</li>
        <li>3D printing software “slices” the model into many 3D cross-sections</li>
        <li>Once printing is finished, the part/object is removed from the bed, and is either
          <ol>
            <li>Finished and ready to be used</li>
            <li>Cleaned up to remove support material</li>
            <li>Cleaned up by removing raft material</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
    
      <h2 name="Materials" id="Materials">Materials</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)</strong> is a thermoplastic that can be found in toy blocks, music recorders and plastic lunch boxes! This popular, 3D printer filament works well for high-printing speeds. </li>
          <li><strong>PLA (PLA (polylactic acid) </strong>is a bioplastic-- which means it's made of starches. It’s harder than ABS and melts at a lower temperature, making it a popular choice for beginners. </li>
          <li><strong>HIPS </strong>is similar to ABS, and prints just as easily—without the potential for warping. It is also a low cost filament option, making it valuable for early stage prototypes, learning, and training. </li>
          <li><strong>NinjaFlex </strong>is a thermoplastic elastomer with rubber-like qualities. Key features include durability, flexibility, and abrasion resistance. Due to the flexibility of this material, optimal printing requires a special extruder-- which is why we developed the Flexystruder, available in the LulzBot online store. </li>
          <li><strong>Laywoo-D3 (LayWood) </strong>is a wood-based 3D printer filament that emits a wood smell when printing. Printing at various temperatures even allows for lighter or darker finishes on your object. Finished LayWood prints can easily be sanded. In general, this filament is just as easy to print with as PLA. </li>
          <li><strong>Laybrick </strong>is a mineral based filament that is popular for creating architectural models because of its low warp qualities and aesthetic appeal. </li>
          <li><strong>T-Glase</strong>, also called “tough glass” is a 100% reclaimable, clear 3D printer filament that features low shrinkage and bridging capabilities. It has the impact-resistant qualities of polycarbonate but is generally easier to print. </li>
          <li><strong>Taulman's Bridge High Strength Nylon Co-Polymer </strong>features the strength of Nylon, yet has the ease of printing of ABS or PLA. </li>
          <li><strong>Taulman's "618" High Strength Nylon Co-Polymer</strong> is white in color, but is easy to dye with fabric dyes. 618 features a translucent surface, advanced chemical resistance and advanced tear-resistance. </li>
          <li><strong>Taulman "645" High Strength Nylon Co-Polymer</strong> is similar to the Taulman 618 filament, but features a slightly higher viscosity than other filament types. </li>
          <li><strong>Polycarbonate</strong>, a tough and impact-resistant thermoplastic, is often used in high impact protective glasses. It will usually bend before it cracks, and is considered an advanced printing material. </li>
        </ul>
