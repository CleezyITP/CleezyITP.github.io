<h1>Introduction to OpenScad</h1>


<h2>Syntax</h2>
<ul>
               <li>left and right parentheses () are like the beginning and end of bits of information/like top and bottom pieced of bread in a sandwich. Everything in between these symbols is included information.</li>
               <li>left and right brackets [], contain values for coordinates [x, y, z]; </li>
               <li>semi colons break up parts of the code, like a period ends a sentence. </li>
              <li>two forward slashes are used to make notes or comments in your code //everything on the same line after this will not be read as code.</li>
              <li> if you are using a screen reader, go through each character to read the code and syntax of the objects and functions that follow.</li>
              <li>We highly recommend working with 3D manipulables as you create objects in 3D space. This will help in understanding the size, translations, rotations and positioning of objects on the plane.</li>
  <li>Numbers in OpenSCAD are in millimeters. So circle(5); or circle(r=5); draws a circle with a radius of 5mm. When modeling in small sizes, shapes will have a lower resolution (rougher texture). </li>
