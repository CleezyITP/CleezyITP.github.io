<h1>Web Development with a Screen Reader</h1>	

<p>Welcome to our web development course and study designed for students that are blind or have low vision.</p>

<p>This course was originally held between 1pm and 4:30pm, weekdays between August 15th and 24th at the Andrew Heiskell Library (40 West 20th St, New York, NY 10011). We moved through these materials in 8 days in pace with student learning. CSS instructional design was supported by the use of <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uZ2uuLXHBm4O_g4VInZrro3U-LgfXKxY?usp=sharing">downloadable tactile manipulatives</a> made using the software TactileView (please email ckv214(at)nyu(dot)edu for a copy of these materials). Students were asked to complete a survey pre and post, to help us improve the course.</p>
