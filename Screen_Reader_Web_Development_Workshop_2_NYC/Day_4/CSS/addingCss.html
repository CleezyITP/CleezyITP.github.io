    <h1>Syntax</h1>

    <p> In the previous example, p (or paragraph) is the selector and font-size: 24 px; is the declaration (thing we want to do to paragraphs). The declaration goes inside left and right braces (often refered to as curly brackets) and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.</p>


    <p> Properties indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, width, height and border. Values specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you want to specify a font-familiy (type of font) property then the value is the font you want the text in these elements is written as follows: </p>

<pre> h1 { font-family: Arial;} </pre>

<h2> Adding CSS to Your Page</h2>


<p> There are different ways you can incorporate CSS into your website. You can link to an external CSS file, you can write CSS directly  in the <em>head</em> of your page by using style tags, or you can write CSS as an attribute of an element. We will focus on creating our CSS in a separate CSS file (the best option for multi-page sites)</p>

<p> To link to a separate css file you fould first create a new file and save it win your website folder. You will need to save this file as a .css filetype. For example, "style.css". </p>

<p> Then, in your HTML, include a link to this file in between your &lt;head> tags. If the css file is in the same folder as your index page, the link should be written as follows: &lt;link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"></p>


<p> Let's break down the attributes in this new link element used to incorporate style in our sites: </p>

<ol>

<li>href - specifies the path to the CSS file. </li>
<li>type - specifies the type of document being linked to. The value should be text/css.</li>
<li>rel - specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to. The value should be stylesheet when linking to a CSS file.</li>

</ol>

<p> in HTML:
<pre>&lt;html>
&lt;head>
&lt;title>Introduction to CSS</title>
&lt;link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
&lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</pre>
