    <h1>Planning your page</h1>

    <p>When you create a webpage, it is important to first think about what your goal is. What is the point of your website? Secondly, what information does a visitor need in order to understand this goal?  Third, you must consider and plan how to organize this information. What is an effective hierarchy of content? <br>

    Many web developers engage in a practice called <em>wireframing</em>. This is useful for designers to determine the layout of a page and how people will interact with the page. Ultimately, it's a to create a proof of concept of your ideas, and a way to describe information contained in elements in a logical order. We must give some thought to the experience of the user/visitors of our websites. Some common questions to get you planning: 

<ol>
<li>What are your goals?</li>
<li>In what order should the information be presented? </li>
<li>What are the steps required for a visitor/user to experience your content, and what types of interactions should be included?</li>
</ol>

In addition to answering these questions for yourself, asking other people helps a lot with this process!</p>
