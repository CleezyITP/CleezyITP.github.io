<h1>Introduction to OpenScad</h1>

<p>OpenSCAD is a free software for creating solid CAD objects that works on Linux/UNIX, Windows and Mac operating systems.</p> 

<p>The program reads statements we write that describe objects. Then renders the 3D model from that code. This gives us full control over the modeling process, and when we get really comfortable with OpenSCAD, we will have the ability to change everything about our designs</p>
<p>OpenSCAD provides two main modeling techniques:</p>
<ol>
<li>Constructive Solid Geometry (our main focus today)</li>
<li>Extrusion of 2D outlines</li>
</ol>
</ul>
