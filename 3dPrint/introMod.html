<h1>3D Modeling</h1>
<h2> What the heck is 3D?</h2>
<p>The 3-dimensional cartesian coordinate system is a geometric system in which three values or parameters  are required to determine the position of an element. These parameters are referred to as x, y, z. Letâ€™s try to recreate these dimensions with found objects! Grab some pens, modeling clay, pipe cleaners</p>

<h2>Creation of 3D Objects</h2>
<p>Computer-aided design (CAD), is technology for design and technical documentation, which replaces manual drafting with an automated process.</p>

<p>CAD is used to design curves and figures in two-dimensional (2D) space; or curves, surfaces, and solids in three-dimensional (3D) space. CAD software is used across automotive, shipbuilding, aerospace, architecture, medical and design industries, as well as, by artists, hobbyists and us.</p> 

<p>The software we are going to use allows us to create using basic three-dimensional geometric forms (cylinders, spheres, cubes) that have solid volumes added or subtracted from them. Two-dimensional projected views can easily be generated from these models.</p>
