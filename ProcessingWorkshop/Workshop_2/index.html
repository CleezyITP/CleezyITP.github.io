<h1>General Intro</h1>

<span>Helpers: Atul, Taeyoon and Claire</span>

<p> Today we are going to continue our introduction to coding concepts and use the notepad text editor to try out some code examples.</p>

<p> Again, we will follow-up with a discussion of p5 editor prototype.</p>


<p>We are doing some web development basics here. We will cover basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the content of a web page, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the visual styling and Javascript handles interaction</p>

<p> Let's begin by introducing ourselves!</p>



<h1>HTML</h1>

<text>HTML (“HyperText Markup Language”) is a language to describe the contents of web documents. It uses a special syntax containing markers (called “elements”) which are wrapped around the text within the document to indicate how user agents (eg. web browsers) should interpret that portion of the document.</text>

        <strong><h2>Punctuation</h2></strong>

                <p>Important punctuation symbols</p>
                

                <ol>
                    <li>In HTML,"< >" angled brackets or tags contain element types. For example, header level one or h1 tags are opened using <"element type"> and closed using < /"element type" ></li>
                        
                        The above mentioned punctuations require left and right symbols to be complete. Forgetting the right or "closing" symbol is one of the most common mistakes that coders make and the # cause of headaches in the United States.  

                        <li>"," commas separate numbers from each other.</li>
                        <li>";" semicolons separate parts of code that need to be identified as complete orders or "thoughts". Like a period in written human language</li>
                </ol>


<strong><h2>Activity 1:</h2></strong>
<ol><text>Let's write out some html together. Go to the file open in the application Notepad++ and run it by using the keyboard shortcut "ctrl+alt+shift+r"</text>

<li> try:
<br>
<br>
< !DOCTYPE html><br>
< html><br>
< head><br>
< meta charset="UTF-8"><br>
< title>title</ title><br>
< /head><br>
< body><br>
  
< /body><br>
< /html><br>
<br>
<br>
IMPORTANT:no spaces after < 
<br><br>
</li>


<li>Try to save it to a new file on your desktop as index.html. Run it and try to break it by leaving out punctuation. </li>

<strong><h2>HTML Tags and Elements</h2></strong>

                <p>these are the meat and potatoes of web content (sorry to any vegetarians)</p>
                

                <ol>
                        <li>Again,angled brackets (<strong>"< >"</strong>) contain element types or tags in HTML and they should always start with <"element type">, followed by your content and end with <"forward slash element type"></li>
                        <li>The <strong>head</strong> tag can contain the document's style, title, meta information and links to accompanying information (separate code folders or libraries). Head tags are written as <"head"> your content <"forward slash head"></li>
                        <li>The <strong>body</strong> tag defines the document's body. The body element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as text, hyperlinks, images, tables, lists, etc. It is written as <"body" > and closed using < forward slash body ></li>
                        <li>The content of a <strong>heading</strong> level one or h1 is contained in <strong><"h1" ></strong> and closed using <strong>< forward slash "h1" ></strong> whatever you write in between is displayed on the screen and read by your screen reader as a higher order heading</li>
                        <li>The content of a heading level two to six or <strong>h2-h6</strong> is displayed on the screen in descending size and read by your screen reader in descending order</li>
                        <li>The <strong><"div"></strong> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The <strong><"div"></strong>tag is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.</li>
                        <li>The <strong><"p"></strong> tag allows you to insert a paragraph of text into a page. It is written as < p>your content< forward slash p>" (without spaces)</li>
                        <li>The <strong><"text"></strong> tag allows you to insert a text into a page without the spacing between as in the paragraph tag. It is written as "< text>your content< /text>" (without spaces)</li>
                        <li> <strong>links</strong> on a page are produced using the <"a"> tag. They are written as "< a "space" href="your link in quotations"> text to be displayed< /a>" (without spaces)</li>
                        <li>The <strong><"button"></strong> tag defines a clickable button.
                        Inside a <strong><"button"></strong> element you can put content, like text or images.</li>
                        <li>The <strong><"nav"></strong> tag defines a set of navigation links.The <strong><"nav"></strong> element is intended only for major block of navigation links.
                        Screen readers, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content.</li>
                        <li>The <strong><"form"></strong> tag is used to create an HTML form for user input.
                        The <strong><"form"></strong> element can contain one or more of the following form elements:
                        <"input">
                        <"textarea">
                        <"button">
                        <"select">
                        <"option">
                        <"optgroup">
                        <"fieldset">
                        <"label">
                        </li>
                </ol>

<strong><h2>HTML Attributes</h2></strong>

<text>Attributes provide additional information about an element and allow us to target them specifically and manipulate them. They are always specified in the start tag and come in name/value pairs like: name="value"<text>

<br>
<br>
<u><p>ID</p></u>
<text> IDs are unique and each element can only have one ID. Each page can have only one element with that ID</text>

<br><text> example:

< p id="Claire"> text here < /p>

</text>

<u><p>Class</p></u>
<text> classes are not unique and you can use the same one on multiple elements. You can also use multiple classes on the same element.</text>

<br><text> example:

< p id="Claire" class="NYU"> text here </ p>
< p id="Atul" class="NYU"> text here </ p>


</text>

<br><text> example:

< img src="h"> text here < /p>

</text>


<h1>Visual conventions and CSS</h1>

    <p>CSS is a language for specifying how documents are visually presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.<br><br>

    CSS is a set of rules that are applied to html to affect how they are displayed. 

    Basically, you can assign values to change how the HTML looks. For example, you can set an element's width to be 50% of its "parent element", and its background to be red.<br><br>

    e.g. 
    
    IN-LINE: <br>
    < p style="width:50%; background-color:red;"> paragraph text< /p><br>
    or, STYLE SHEET (linked to in the head tag)<br>
    
    p{<br>
    background-color:red;<br>
    }<br>
<br>
    #Claire{<br>
    background-color:red;<br>
    }<br>
<br>
    .NYU{<br>
    background-color:red;<br>
    }<br>
<br>
    A selector, which selects the element(s) you want to apply the updated property values to. For example, you can apply CSS rules to <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>All the paragraphs in my HTML document. </li>
        <li>All the paragraphs with the class in my HTML document. </li>
        <li>The paragraphs with the class in my HTML document. </li>
    </ul>

     <p>Parent and Child Elements</p>

    <text>Elements that begin and contain other elements are parents to those elements. Elements that are contained within another are its children. <br><br>

    The convention is to create an indent or "tab" when creating child elements

<h1>Coding as instruction set</h1>

<p>"pseudo code" is not actually code, but is a rehearsal that helps you understand how to operationalize and structure your actual code
</p>

<h1>ReIntroduction to Algorithms</h1>

<p>Code and algorithms are just a set of instructions we give to computers to complete a task. Computers need to be told exactly what to do before they can do anything. </p>

<h1>Javascript</h1>

<p>What happens when we want to interact with a website? We need Javascript! Javascript is the most popular coding language in the world. We use it to change HTML element content (innerHTML), attributes as well as collect, manipulate and validate data.</p>


<ul>
<li>In javascript, "{}" curly braces are like a fence that protects the statements that live inside.</li>
<li>In javascript, "()" left paren, right paren - parentheses contain parameters for the statements.</li>

</ul>

<h1>Variables</h1>

<text>variables come in many types, but are all declared in the same way:<br><br>

a) var message = “Hello” <br>

b) var collectionOfMessage = [“hi”, “goodbye”,“nice to meet you”]

</text>


<p>Variables are simply placeholders for data and meant to change with our interactions and other variables. Variables are like a big bucket with a name on it. You can put anything you want in that bucket, but the name stays the same. In this way, we change the value of the variable but not the name of it.</p>

<p>In Javascript, we first declare our variable name and its original value. We write var name; We then initialize it by giving it a value. We write var name=any number, or string of text in quotations; After you declare and initialize your variable, you can call upon it a number of times and reassign its value. In our First example, we will have a counter variable that starts at zero, but adds 1 every time a button is pressed. 

Global Variables − A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.

Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.

<h1>Functions</h1>

<p> Like when we had to perform several sub tasks in order to tie our shoes, a function is a "subprogram" that can be called by code. Like the whole program itself, a function is composed of a sequence of statements. Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value. </p>

<h1>Procedures and Generalizations</h1>


        <p>Operators can be very useful for coding complex behaviors. Common relational and operators include:</p>
                
        <strong><text>Relational:</text></strong>

        <ul>
        <li>The greater than symbol = > </li>
                <li>The less than symbol = <  </li>
                </ul>

                <strong><text>Assignment:</text></strong>

       <ul><li>The equal symbol assigns something as = </li></ul>

<strong><h2>while loops</h2></strong>

<text> what happens when we want to do the same thing over and over again?<br>
Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.<br>
</text>

        <strong><h2>Activity:</h2></strong>


< script><br>
    var bottle=99;<br>
    var song=' ';<br>
    while (bottle>0){<br>
        song = song + bottle + "bottles of beer on the wall";<br>
        bottle--;<br>
    }<br>
    document.write(song);<br>
</ script> <br>

<h1><a href="http://mathuramg.com/CodeMirrorTest/version1/">p5 test!</a></h1>

<ul>
<li>Is the content readable by Voiceover or JAWS?</li>
<li>Is it possible to bring the editor into focus?</li>
<li>How is the feedback from the editor while typing? Are the letter read out?</li>
<li>Are the line number read out?</li>
<li>Currently, the autocomplete is turned on for brackets and parenthesis. Implying you type the left parenthesis and the right one is automatically typed in. Is that feature usable with screen readers?</li>
