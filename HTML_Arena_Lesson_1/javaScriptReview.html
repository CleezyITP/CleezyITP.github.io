<h1>JavaScript Review</h1>

<h2> Introduction</h2>

<p>Javascript is used to make websites interactive. Javascript is a set of rules/instructions for your browser to follow. These step by step instructions are like directions or a recipe.</p>

<p>It is used to access and modify content in your webpages. You can use javascript to select any element, attibute or text in your HTML and either change them in some way or add new elements, attibutes or text.</p>

<p>Secondly, you can use javaScript to program a series of actions, or rules involved in changing your HTML. For example, you could program a currency calculator to change Ugandan shillings to US dollars, or convert the temperature from Farenheit to celsius and display the results on the screen. </p>

<p>Finally, you can create scripts that react to certain events in the browser, like when a button is pressed, a link is selected, or a certain amount of time has passed.</p>

<p>computers create "models" using data. These models are comprised of objects. Objects contain: 
	<ul>
		<li>properties that tell us some information about the object</li>
		<li>methods that that perform tasks based on properties</li>
		<li>events that are triggered when users interact with the computer</li>
	</ul>

To put this into context, the web browser you use (firefox, chrome, etc.) uses HTML markup to create a model of a webpage. Each element creates its own object/node that has attribute properties (classes, ids, alt text, etc.). Javascript makes webpages interactive by attaching events to the browser's model of a webpage</p>
<h2>Where to include Javascript</h2>

<p>Like CSS, you can add javascript directly into the body of your HTML files using a script tag. For example, 

<pre>
&#x3C;html>
&#x3C;head>
&#x3C;/head>
&#x3C;body>
&#x3C;h1>my heading&#x3C;h1>
&#x3C;script>some code&#x3C;/script>
&#x3C;/body>
&#x3C;/html>

</pre>

However, it is always best to create javascript in a seperate file and save it with a dot js file type. For example, I could name my file script.js. 

<h2>Activity 1</h2> 

<p> As an example, the javascript example folder (linked to below) contains a folder with an html file, a css file and a javascript file. The javascript file is linked to in the following way</p>

<pre>
&#x3C;html>
&#x3C;head>
&#x3C;title>Javascript Example 1&#x3C;/title>
&#x3C;link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
&#x3C;script src="script.js">&#x3C;/script>
&#x3C;/head>
&#x3C;body>
&#x3C;h1>my heading&#x3C;h1>
&#x3C;/body>
&#x3C;/html>

</pre>

<p>For this activity, read the entire list of steps and then do the following:

	<ul>
		<li>download and open the <a href="javascriptExample.zip">javascript example zip file.</a></li>
		<li>Note that the text "hello world" is rendered to the browser, also note that it is not in the html, rather, it is created with javascript in the javascript file.</li>
		<li>Edit the hello world message to create your own.</li>
	</ul>

		</p>



<h2>How to write JavaScript...</h2>

<p>In order to write javascript, you must first define your goal, then break each step down into smaller steps. The most effective way to write code, is to first write pseudo-code, or to write down your goal and the series of tasks that are required to complete it, in human language.</p>

<h3>Activity 2</h3>

<p>Write out the steps required to either a. tie your shoes, or b. to move from one classroom to another at your school. Be as detailed as you can. Once you have your instructions, try to perform the task and notice whether your plan guides you to the goal, or if there are steps missing. This type of activity (breaking down a task into several steps) and way of thinking is very helpful when writing javascript. Share your thoughts in the WhatsApp chat group!</p>
