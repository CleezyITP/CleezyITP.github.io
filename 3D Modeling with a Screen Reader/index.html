    <h2 name="Additive Manufacturing" id="Additive Manufacturing">Additive Manufacturing</h2>  
      <ul>   
        <li>This is a method of rapid prototyping in which digital models are “sliced” into many 2 dimensional cross-sections that are then “printed” one on top of the other.</li>
         <li>3D printing is an additive manufacturing process that creates 3D objects from 3D digital information.  </li>
          <li> The technique of additive manufacturing has existed for centuries.</li>
          <li>The ancient Greeks built columns in a way that these large objects are formed by assembling smaller layers. </li>
        </ul> 
    <h2 name="Types of 3D Printing" id="Types of 3D Printing">Types of 3D Printing</h2>
      <ul>   
        <li>FDM fused deposition modeling: material is heated into a softened state and extruded from a nozzle – the bed is lowered as the object assembles</li>
        <li>SLA/DLP machine Stereolithography/Digital Light Processing: a bed is lowered into a volume of liquid polymer, and a laser or focused light cures the material to a hardened state in layers as the bed moves away from the liquid.</li>
        <li>SLS Selective Laser Sintering: a powder is used in place of a liquid or a solid polymer, and a laser “sinters” or cures the powder in layers which are added by a sweeper.</li>
      </ul>

        <li>Modelling with software or scanning/photogrammetry techniques</li>
        <li>3D printing software “slices” the model into many 3D cross-sections</li>
        <li>Once printing is finished, the part/object is removed from the bed, and is either
          <ol>
            <li>Finished and ready to be used</li>
            <li>Cleaned up to remove support material</li>

    <h2 name="Hardware" id="Hardware">Hardware</h2>
      <h3 name="" id="">Materials</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)</strong> is a thermoplastic that can be found in toy blocks, music recorders and plastic lunch boxes! This popular, 3D printer filament works well for high-printing speeds. </li>
          <li><strong>PLA (PLA (polylactic acid) </strong>is a bioplastic-- which means it's made of starches. It’s harder than ABS and melts at a lower temperature, making it a popular choice for beginners. </li>
          <li><strong>HIPS </strong>is similar to ABS, and prints just as easily—without the potential for warping. It is also a low cost filament option, making it valuable for early stage prototypes, learning, and training. </li>
          <li><strong>NinjaFlex </strong>is a thermoplastic elastomer with rubber-like qualities. Key features include durability, flexibility, and abrasion resistance. Due to the flexibility of this material, optimal printing requires a special extruder-- which is why we developed the Flexystruder, available in the LulzBot online store. </li>
          <li><strong>Laywoo-D3 (LayWood) </strong>is a wood-based 3D printer filament that emits a wood smell when printing. Printing at various temperatures even allows for lighter or darker finishes on your object. Finished LayWood prints can easily be sanded. In general, this filament is just as easy to print with as PLA. </li>
          <li><strong>Laybrick </strong>is a mineral based filament that is popular for creating architectural models because of its low warp qualities and aesthetic appeal. </li>
          <li><strong>T-Glase</strong>, also called “tough glass” is a 100% reclaimable, clear 3D printer filament that features low shrinkage and bridging capabilities. It has the impact-resistant qualities of polycarbonate but is generally easier to print. </li>
          <li><strong>Taulman's Bridge High Strength Nylon Co-Polymer </strong>features the strength of Nylon, yet has the ease of printing of ABS or PLA. </li>
          <li><strong>Taulman's "618" High Strength Nylon Co-Polymer</strong> is white in color, but is easy to dye with fabric dyes. 618 features a translucent surface, advanced chemical resistance and advanced tear-resistance. </li>
          <li><strong>Taulman "645" High Strength Nylon Co-Polymer</strong> is similar to the Taulman 618 filament, but features a slightly higher viscosity than other filament types. </li>
          <li><strong>Polycarbonate</strong>, a tough and impact-resistant thermoplastic, is often used in high impact protective glasses. It will usually bend before it cracks, and is considered an advanced printing material. </li>
        </ul>
      <h3 name="Printers" id="Printers">Printers</h3>
        Here are some common commerically available printers:

        </ol>
    <h2 name="Software " id="Software ">Software </h2>
        <p>Computer aided design or CAD in general can produce Solids or Meshes. Modeling in solids is advantageous for 3D printing since models will be more precise. All models are exported to meshes before printing. 3D Primitives (e.g. Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, Torus) are used to create complex objects. Today we will review the following:</p>

      <h3 name="OpenSCAD Basics" id="OpenSCAD Basics">OpenSCAD Basics</h3>
        <h4 name="" id="">Syntax</h4>
          <ul>
               <li>3D workspace is unlike classic cartesian plane. X, is left and right in 3D space. Y, is toward and away from user. Z, is up and down. </li>
               <li> Syntax: left and right parentheses () are like the beginning and end of bits of information/like top and bottom pieced of bread in a sandwich. Everything in between these symbols is included information.</li>
               <li>left and right brackets [], contain values for coordinates [x, y, z]; </li>
               <li>semi colons break up parts of the code, like a period ends a sentence. </li>
              <li>two forward slashes are used to make notes or comments in your code //everything on the same line after this will not be read as code</li>
              <li> if you are using a screen reader, go through each character to read the code and syntax of the objects and functions that follow</li>
          </ul>


        <h4 name="" id="">Primitives</h4>
         These are the basic shapes that are the building blocks of our designs.
        <ol>
          <li>cube([10, 20, 15], center = true);  
            <ul>
              <li>in case your screen reader does not read all of the punctuation, write the following: cube a left parentheses a left bracket a value for x a value for y and a value for z followed by a right bracket a comma then center = true a right paren and finally a semi-colon. </li>
              <li>The default for cubes is that they are rendered with a center at [x/2,y/2,z/2]</li>
            </ul>
          <li>sphere(r = 20);  //r stands for radius. The default for spheres is that they are rendered in the center [0,0,0]</li>
          <li>cylinder(h = 40, r1 = 20, r2 = 20); //h is the height of your cylinder. r1 and r2 are the radii of top and botton circles.</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Alternatively, you can just write r=20: cylinder(h = 40, r = 20); </li>
                <li>To create a cone shape, make one radius equal to zero: cylinder(h = 40, r1 = 20, r2 = 0); </li>
              </ul>
        </ol>



<h4 name="" id="">Translate</h4>

<p>Translate helps you move objects in the workplane. Translations are written as follows: translate( [x-value, y-value, z-value]);</p>

<p>Positive X values, move objects to the right. Negative X values, move objects to the left. Positive Y values, move objects away from the user. Negative Y values, move objects toward the user. Positive Z values, move objects up. Negative Z values, move objects down. </p>

<ol>
<li>This is how you move an object away from the center of the workplane:
<pre>￼
translate( [0, 0, 20])
      sphere(r = 20);</pre>
</li>

<li>The primitive below a translate line and before the semi-colon that is found at the end of the sphere, gets moved. 

<pre>￼
translate( [-20, 0, 20])
  cube( [30,30,30]);
</pre></li>

</ol>



<h4 name="" id="">Rotate</h4>

<ol>
<li>The following will an object 45 degrees along the x axis:
<pre>
rotate([45, 0, 0])
  cube([10, 20, 15]);
</pre></li>
<li>￼When you include a second rotate, the origin (or 0,0,0) for the second rotation will be based on the forst rotation. Each influences the next and they do not rotate independently.   
<pre>  
rotate([0, -30, 0])  // then applied second
  rotate([45, 0, 0]) // applied first
    cube([10, 20, 15]);
</pre></li>    

  

 <h4 name="" id="">Scaling</h4>

<p>Scaling will help you bend and shape your primitives.
<pre>
scale([1, 1, 1.5])
 sphere(r = 10);
</pre>This creates an egg shape.</p>
 
<h4 name="" id="">Union</h4>
<p>Union joins together objects and is the sum of all shapes between its brackets. 
 <pre>
union() {
  cylinder(h = 40, r = 10, center = true);
  rotate([90, 0, 0])
    cylinder (h = 40, r = 9, center = true);
}
</pre>
</p>

 <h4 name="" id="">Difference</h4>
<p> 
Difference is using the second shape (and all subsequent shapes in the bracket) to cut out from the first shape.
<pre>
difference() {
  cylinder(h = 40, r = 10, center = true);
  rotate([90, 0, 0])
    cylinder(40, r = 9, center = true);
}
</pre></p>
