<h1>Intro to 3D Printing</h1>
<h2>Additive Manufacturing</h2>
<ul>
<li>3D printing is an additive manufacturing process that creates 3d objects </li>
<li>In really general terms, the process begins by creating designs from 3 Dimensions or parameters. Then these digital models are sliced into many 2 dimensional cross-sections that are then printed one on top of the other.</li>
<li>This slicing and rebuilding of shapes is referred to as additive manufacturing</li>
<li>As a technique, additive manufacturing has existed for centuries</li>
<li>For example, ancient Greeks built large columns by assembling smaller layers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Different types of 3D Printing Mechanisms</h2>
<ul>
<li>FDM –fused deposition modeling –  the plastic printers we use here material is heated into a softened state and extruded from a nozzle – the bed is lowered as the object assembles.</li>
<li>SLA/DLP machine Stereolithography / Digital Light Processing - a bed is lowered into a volume of liquid polymer, and a laser or focused light cures the material to a hardened state in layers as the bed moves away from the liquid.</li>
<li>SLS Selective Laser Sintering- a powder is used in place of a liquid or a solid polymer, and a laser “sinters” or cures the powder in layers which are added by a sweeper.</li>
</ul>
